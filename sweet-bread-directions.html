<li>Combine milk and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat until slightly warm to the touch then remove from heat and stir in yeast. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir together flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add softened butter, eggs, and the yeast mixture and mix until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
<li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface and continue to knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Grease a large bowl with 1 tablespoon oil. Place the dough into the bowl and 
turn once to coat. Cover and let stand in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
<li>Grease a cookie sheet or 9x13-inch pan with remaining oil.</li>
<li>For plain rolls, punch down dough and divide into 12 equal pieces. Roll the pieces into balls and place them into the greased pan side by side. Cover and let dough rise again until almost doubled in 
size, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven until rolls are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
