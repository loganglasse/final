<li>Place 1 1/3 cups warm water, olive oil, flour, brown sugar, 
salt, and yeast into a bread machine in the order listed, or follow 
the order recommended by your manufacturer if different. Run the 
Dough cycle, about 90 minutes.</li>
<li>Sprinkle cornmeal onto a cutting board. Punch down dough, turn 
out onto a lightly floured surface, and form into two loaves. Place 
loaves, seam-side down, onto the cutting board; cover with a damp 
cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
<li>Beat egg and 1 tablespoon water together in a small bowl; brush 
over risen loaves.</li>
<li>Use a sharp knife to quickly cut one long slash down the center 
of each loaf. Gently shake the cutting board to make sure the loaves 
are not sticking; use a spatula or pastry knife to loosen them if 
necessary. Slide loaves onto a baking sheet with a quick but careful 
motion.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven until loaves are golden brown and 
sound hollow when tapped on the bottom, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
